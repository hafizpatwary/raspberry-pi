#cloud-config


# This is the user-data configuration file for cloud-init. By default this sets
# up an initial user called "ubuntu" with password "ubuntu", which must be
# changed at first login. However, many additional actions can be initiated on
# first boot from this file. The cloud-init documentation has more details:
#
# https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/
#
# Some additional examples are provided in comments below the default
# configuration.

# On first boot, set the (default) ubuntu user's password to "ubuntu" and
# expire user passwords
#chpasswd:
#  expire: true
#  list:
#  - ubuntu:ubuntu

# Enable password authentication with the SSH daemon
ssh_pwauth: true

## Add users and groups to the system, and import keys with the ssh-import-id
## utility
groups:
  - hafiz: [hafiz]
users:
  - name: hafiz
    gecos: Hafiz
    primary_group: hafiz
    groups: hafiz
    sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    ssh_authorized_keys: [{{ SSH_AUTHORISED_KEYS }}]
